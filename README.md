Code for probing is a hard fork from [allup](https://github.com/jcornaz/allup)
The main idea came from allup, however the goal is to make this cli more distributable and to extend functionality in diffrent ways.

Goals:
- generate github action (cron job)
- server mode
- generate docker image with server mode
